Simulator Launcher
==================

Simulator Launcher is a Mac App that allows you to launch an iOS App (that has been built for the simulator) on the iOS Simulator. Apps can be launched using any available device and iOS version.

Simulator Launcher works by wrapping the command line utility [ios-sim](https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim).

Requires Xcode 6.
