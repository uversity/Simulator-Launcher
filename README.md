Simulator Launcher
==================

Requires Xcode 6.

Simulator Launcher is a Mac App that allows you to launch an iOS App (that has been built for the simulator) on the iOS Simulator.

Simulator Launcher works by wrapping the command line utility [ios-sim](https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim).
